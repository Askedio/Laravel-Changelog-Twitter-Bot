# Laravel Changelog Twitter Bot
A really simple bot that reads laravels change log from github and posts to twitter.

Not intended to be great code, a few hours of work - that I must stop to get back to my job :X

# Commands
* 'latest version'
* 'thank you'
* 'update link' or 'link is'
* 'is really' or 'twitter account is
* 'is on twitter'
